# diabetes-prediction-app
A simple machine learning web application for diabetes prediction built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn. The app uses a trained model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input.





Early Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict the onset of diabetes at an early stage based on diagnostic patient records. It features a trained classification model that has been deployed on an interactive web application using Streamlit.

ðŸ“– Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a reliable predictive model that can identify individuals at high risk of diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset of 768 patient records and utilizes various machine learning techniques for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification. The final model is accessible through a user-friendly web interface.

âœ¨ Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and scales features for optimal model performance.


Machine Learning Model: An end-to-end pipeline that trains a classifier to predict diabetes with high accuracy.


Interactive Web App: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for users to input their health metrics and get a prediction.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
The project is built using the following technologies and libraries:


Languages: Python 


Libraries:

Pandas (for data manipulation) 


NumPy (for numerical operations) 


Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation) 


Matplotlib (for data visualization) 


Streamlit (for building the web application) 

ðŸŽ¯ Model & Evaluation
The machine learning model was trained on a dataset of 768 patient records and achieved an 

accuracy of over 92%.

The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using the following metrics:

Cross-validation 

Confusion Matrix 

Precision/Recall 

F1-Score
